# desktop-streamer

Stream desktop applications to Google Cast in an automated fashion. The intent of this project is to fully automate a VM with a headless XSession being streamed to a chromecast as a video stream.

There is arguably no particular reason for this other than because we can, chromecast already has support for mirroring a whole desktop, the main reason for the existence of this project is to try and stream an automated headless XSession.
